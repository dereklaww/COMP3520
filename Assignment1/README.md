# Problem 

There are K barbers, which take T1 min and T2 max units of time to service one customer

The salon has N waiting chairs. 

Customer steps:
1. Arrives
2. If there are free waiting chairs, customer takes ticket and sits
3. If there are no tickets (and no chairs), customer leaves

Tickets are always numbered from 1 to N in perfect cyclic order.

There is one shop assistant looking after the customers. When a barber becomes available, the assistant will call one waiting customer to get harcut by that barber. 

Customers will be called in a first-come-first-served order, without the ability in choosing barbers.
